# Hello World

## So, why am I here?
After months, and months of working with PLCs, EPMS, and essentially pushing buttons on a GUI developed by someone else, I find myself sinking further and further into depression. 

The life of working a 9 to 5 just isn't enough for me. There is no replacing that thrill when I get to develope something I can call my own, so here I am, embarking on my own journey.

## What will this be?
Over the years, I've made many plans:
1. Go to the gym 5 days a week, and become shredded
    - Needless to say, I did not become shredded
2. Do my bureaucratic, HR work on time every Friday at 4p
    - It remains a thorn at my side to this day...
3. Start journaling
    - Did you know journals are oddly expensive?

I've begun to notice that any time I start to fall behind on a scheduled "master plan", my motivation simply sinks lower and lower. So, instead, let's try this instead:

below are the tech stack I would like to understand:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- C#

To achieve the above, I will follow the [Oden Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to the letter. Maybe one day...I can have a sick website registered under my own name. Something, something, claiming my own spot in this world.

## Chisels and Rocks
The desire to abandon tools and learn everything in its most fundamental forms is always driving me. However, in the world we live in today, unless I pick up one rock and start chiseling another, there's no escaping tools. 

So, for future me, below are the tools I used on this Journey:
### Development Tools
- Linux Ubuntu 24.04.01 LTS
- Visual Studio Code
- DeepSeek V3
- Crates of Caffeine

### Knowledge Base
- [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
- [The Oden Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)
- [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

If I ever say I'm a self made man, feel free to kick my ass with the weight of all open sourced knowledge.
